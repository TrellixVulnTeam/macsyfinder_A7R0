The :ref:`Profile object <profile-implementation>` is used for the search of the gene with Hmmer. A *"Profile"* must match a HMM protein profile file, which name is based on the profile name. For instance, the *gspG* gene has the corresponding "gspG.hmm" profile file provided at a dedicated location.
